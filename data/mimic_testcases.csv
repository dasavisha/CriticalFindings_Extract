Findings are consistent with ileus but correlate clinically and with follow up if indicated to rule out small bowel obstruction .
"1 ) Diffuse gallbladder wall thickening/edema as described above . These findings are suggestive of acalculous cholecystitis , given the patient ' s clinical history . Other etiologies include CHF , hypoalbuminemia , volume overload and hepatitis . 2 ) Small bilateral pleural effusions . The above findings were discussed in detail with the house staff caring for the patient at the time of the examination ."
Increased signal in the basal ganglia on T1 weighted images could be related to hepatic insufficiency and clinical correlation recommended . No evidence of mass effect midline shift or hydrocephalus . No abnormal enhancement to indicate brain metastases .
"1 ) Placement of right chest tube , no pneumothorax . 2 ) Bilateral low lung volumes and probable bibasilar atelectases ."
"1 ) High grade mechanical obstruction , with an appearance of a closed loop obstruction of small bowel in the right lower quadrant ( If this patient has a surgical history , adhesions could also be the cause ). There is no bowel wall edema to suggest ischemic or necrotic bowel . 2 ) Large extraluminal intraperitoneal air collection . This collection does not appear contiguous with the bowel . It does not move much with changes in position but it is difficult to explain how it could become so loculated . 3 ) Large amount of stool throughout the entire colon without evidence of diverticulitis ."
1 ) 70 stenosis involving the proximal portion of the right internal carotid artery in the neck . 2 ) Linear intimal flap within the proximal portion of the left internal carotid artery most likely resulting from prior dissection . There is no significant narrowing of the lumen at the present time . Correlation with carotid duplex would be helpful .
"Acute left subdural hemorrhage over the parietal convexity with a mass effect and midline shift . Subarachnoid hemorrhage , intraparanchymal hemorrhage and contusion as described above ."
"No evidence of pulmonary embolism , as discussed above ."
CT evaluation of the pelvis reveals no fractures or dislocations . There are bilateral degenerative changes of hip joints along with facet joint hypertrophy of the lower lumbar spine .
Multiple areas of low attenuation and encephalomalacia which are unchanged . No acute changes . No significant interval changes . If symptoms persists a follow up CT may be performed as clinically warranted .
1 ) No evidence of pneumoperitoneum . 2 ) Interval removal of the Swan-Ganz catheter . The sheath remains in position . 3 ) Advancement of the NG tube approximately 5 cm is recommended .
"1 . Large left subdural hematoma and extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage , causing massive shift of the midline towards the right and uncal herniation . 2 . Multiple fractures as described . Findings were discussed with Trauma Team at the time of the exam ."
